for me about modulus operations:

it calculates the remainder of division
10%8 = 2; because 8 goes into 10 once and 2 is left over.
10%3 = 1; because 3 goes into 10 three times (3*3=9) then 10-9=1
10%2 = 0; because 2 goes into 10 exactly 5 times, there is no remainder
10%20 = 10; because 20 goes into 10 zero times, 10 is the remainder

for x > n
x % n = x - (a * n)
where (a) is an integer equal to (x / n)

for x < n
x % n = x

also
x % x = 0
